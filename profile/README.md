The [spell-check-this template repository](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this) includes the basic configuration to use the [check-spelling github action](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling).
This enables you to get started easily, just drop the repository contents into your repository and adjust settings as necessary. 

# [🍴 checkout-merge action](https://github.com/check-spelling/checkout-merge)

The [checkout-merge github action](https://github.com/check-spelling/checkout-merge) is a helper action for repositories that receive pull requests and need to validate the potential merge result of the pull request.

This action works around bugs in GitHub's current method of maintaining a `refs/pulls/X/merge`. One such bug involves GitHub serving a stale merge if the current branch isn't mergable.

It also offers a friendlier user experience for when there isn't a merge available because of merge conflicts.
